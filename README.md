# Fresnel
This repository contains a useful tool for optics and photonics. Specifically, you will find matlab files to compute the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients for generic (multilayered) bianisotropic planar media. 

Please refer to the documentation.pdf in the repository for details regarding how to compute these coefficients. 

If you are using it for your research, you can cite the following published work.
